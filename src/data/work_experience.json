      "Architected an AI-powered call center assistant that provides real-time smart suggestions to representatives based on live transcription analysis, helping agents close deals faster and improve conversion rates",
      "Improved end-to-end suggestion latency from 3–4 seconds to under 1.5 seconds by parallelizing context retrieval, optimizing chunking strategy, and tuning AWS Lambda memory to reduce cold-start overhead",
      "Redesigned the retrieval pipeline using layout-aware hierarchical chunking with sparse search, dense vector search, and cross-encoder re-ranking, improving context relevance during live calls",
      "Built event-driven backend services with AWS SAM and CI/CD pipelines, implementing session-based authentication with auto-refresh and multi-tenant RBAC for 50+ concurrent sessions",
      "Reworked authentication architecture by separating authentication and authorization into dedicated middleware, reducing request complexity and improving maintainability using Redis-backed sessions",
      "Implemented production security hardening including webhook signature verification, CORS enforcement, and authorization middleware to prevent injection and scripting attacks"
